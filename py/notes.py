# # Welcome to python programming
# # python is a language for computer programming which is automated and interactive for
# # domains like machine learning and data analytics
# # python is also used for web developent and game developent
# # python is a cross-platform language
# # python is free and open source


# # Concepts
# # variables
# x = 10
# y = 20

# print(x, y)


# # data types
# a = 50  # integer
# b = 5.5  # float
# c = "hello"  # string
# d = True  # boolean

# print(a)  # we are using print function to print the variables and values
# print(b)  # we are using print function to print the variables and values
# print(c)  # we are using print function to print the variables and values
# print(d)  # we are using print function to print the variables and values
# # we can print their values in a single print statement

# # Loops
# i = 0
# while i < 10:
#     print(i)
#     i = i + 1

# # if-else
# age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
# if age < 18:
#     print("You are not eligible to vote")
# else:
#     print("You are eligible to vote")


# # constants
# PI = 3.14
# print(PI)


# # functions
# def add(a, b):  # function to add two numbers def is used to define a function
#     return a + b


# print(add(33, 44))


# def sub(a, b):
#     return a - b


# print(sub(33, 44))


# dictionaries:-
# a dictionary is a collection of key-value pairs
# which allows us to store data in a structured way
# it works like a hash map
# enables fast look up of values based on keys


# Lambda functions:-
# lambda functions are small anonymous functions
# they are defined using the lambda keyword
# they are used to create short and simple functions
# they are often used in functional programming

# map function:-
# map function is used to apply a function to each element of a sequence
# it returns a new sequence with the function applied to each element

# filter function:-
# filter function is used to filter elements of a sequence based on a condition
# it returns a new sequence with the elements that meet the condition

# reduce function:-
# reduce function is used to reduce a sequence to a single value
# it applies a function to each element of the sequence and returns the result

# zip function:-
# zip function is used to combine two sequences into a single sequence
# it returns a new sequence with the elements of the two sequences combined

# enumerate function:-
# enumerate function is used to add a counter to an iterable
# it returns a new sequence with the elements of the iterable paired with their index

# sorted function:-
# sorted function is used to sort a sequence
# it returns a new sequence with the elements of the sequence sorted


# lists and tuples:-
# lists are mutable
# tuples are immutable

# sets: -
# sets are unordered collections of unique elements
# it allows us to perform set operations like union, intersection, difference and avoid duplicates


# generators:-
# generators are functions that return a sequence of values
# they are defined using the yield keyword

# decorators:-
# decorators are functions that modify the behavior of other functions
# they are defined using the @ symbol

# iterators:-
# iterators are objects that can be iterated over
# they are defined using the __iter__ method

# OOP:-
# OOP is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes to model real-world entities
# it is based on the concept of encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism and abstraction.

# Class:-
# a class is a blueprint for creating objects
# it defines the attributes and methods of the object
# it is defined using the class keyword

# Object:-
# an object is an instance of a class
# it is created by calling the class constructor
# it is defined using the __init__ method (this is a constructor)

# Polymorphism:-
# polymorphism is the ability of objects to take on multiple forms
# it is achieved by overloading and overriding

# Abstraction:-
# abstraction is the process of hiding the implementation details of an object
# it is achieved by using abstract classes and interfaces

# Encapsulation:-
# encapsulation is the process of hiding the implementation details of an object
# it is achieved by using private and protected members

# Inheritance:-
# inheritance is the process of creating a new class based on an existing class
# it is achieved by using the extends keyword

# Multithreading:-
# multithreading is the process of executing multiple threads concurrently
# it is achieved by using the threading module

# Modules:-
# modules are files containing Python code
# they are used to organize and reuse code
# they are imported using the import keyword
